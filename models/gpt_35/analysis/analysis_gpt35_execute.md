# Analysis Metrics for GPT-3.5 (Executable Prompt)

# Summary
This code ran perfectly. Although it did not contain some of the features asked for in the base prompt, it did execute on the first try. Subjectively, it looks even better than the base prompt. 

## 1. Accuracy

Accuracy measures how closely the generated scripts align with the provided prompts or specifications.

- **Exact Match:** The script did exactly what it was prompted to do. 
- **Score:** 100%

## 2. Feature Completeness

Feature Completeness measures the extent to which the generated scripts incorporate the requested game features and mechanics.
