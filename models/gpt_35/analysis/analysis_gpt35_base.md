# Analysis Metrics for GPT-3.5 (Base Prompt)

# Summary
This code ran shockingly well. The aesthetics were average, but the script executed without any issues. The only thing to be worked on is the game over screen.

## 1. Accuracy

Accuracy measures how closely the generated scripts align with the provided prompts or specifications.

- **Partial Match:** The script generated was able to run and play the game, but the game over screen wasn't implemented correctly.
- **Score:** 90%

## 2. Feature Completeness

Feature Completeness measures the extent to which the generated scripts incorporate the requested game features and mechanics.

- **Feature List:** 
1. Initialization of Pygame
2. Set display dimensions
3. Define color constants
4. Set snake and apple size
5. Set game speed
6. Initialize fonts for displaying messages
7. Set up display surface

15. Boundary collision checks to trigger game over
16. Update snake position based on movement
17. Draw the apple on the screen
18. Update the snake's length and position
19. Self-collision check to trigger game over
20. Eating the apple to increase snake length and reposition apple
21. Control game frame rate using the clock
22. Close Pygame and quit the program

- **Scoring:** 21/22

## 3. Bug Frequency

Bug Frequency evaluates the number and severity of defects in the generated scripts.

- **Execute on first try?:** Yes
- **Count of Bugs:** 1

### Bug 1: Game over screen does not fit in frame
- **Bug Severity:** Major
- **Complexity of Fixes:** Moderate

```
# Function to display messages
def message(msg, color):
    rendered_msg = font_style.render(msg, True, color)
    game_display.blit(rendered_msg, [display_width / 6, display_height / 3])
```
```Fix: display_width / 6 -> display_width / 16```
