# Analysis Metrics for GPT-3.5 (Feature Prompt)

# Summary
This code ran into some fatal issues when executing on the first run. Although, once the bug was fixed, it seemed to run quite well. Surprisingly, even when prompted for more features, it failed to provide features included in the base prompt, such as keeping score, and an option to replay the game once it was over.

## 1. Accuracy

Accuracy measures how closely the generated scripts align with the provided prompts or specifications.

- **Partial Match:** The script could not execute on the first try. Also, it contained less features than the original base prompt. 
- **Score:** 40%

## 2. Feature Completeness

Feature Completeness measures the extent to which the generated scripts incorporate the requested game features and mechanics.

- **Feature List:** 
1. Initialization of Pygame
2. Screen setup with dimensions and display mode
3. Constants for colors (white, black, red, green, blue)
4. Definition of grid size and screen grid dimensions
5. Snake class initialization including position and movement direction
6. Move method for updating the snake's position
7. Change direction method to change the snake's direction
8. **Grow snake method to increase the snake's size** (Fatal error)
9. Draw method to display the snake on the screen
10. Food class initialization with random position placement
11. Random position generation method for food
12. Draw method to display the food on the screen
13. Game over function to handle end-of-game scenario
14. Main game loop function with event handling for quitting and arrow key inputs
15. Movement and growth handling of the snake
16. Collision detection for food consumption
17. Boundary and self-collision checks
18. Drawing snake and food
19. Screen refresh and frame rate control
20. Check for running the game script directly

- **Scoring:** 19/20

## 3. Bug Frequency

Bug Frequency evaluates the number and severity of defects in the generated scripts.

- **Execute on first try?:** No
- **Count of Bugs:** 1

### Bug 1: Index Error in move():
- **Bug Severity:** Critical
- **Complexity of Fixes:** Moderate

Problem code:
```
def move(self):
        if not self.grow:
            self.body.pop()
```
Error:
```
    head = self.body[0]
           ~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range
```

```Fix: Set grow = True  ```
