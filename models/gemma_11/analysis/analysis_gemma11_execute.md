# Analysis Metrics for Gemma 1.1 (Base Prompt)

# Summary
This code was able to run on the first try, so in terms of generating code with no bugs it did a great job. But unfortunately, the features it did add were implemented VERY poorly. (See screenshot).
Also, basic features like getting the snake to respond to direction events didn't work at all.

## 1. Accuracy

Accuracy measures how closely the generated scripts align with the provided prompts or specifications.

- **Partial Match:** The script was able to execute, as requested, but the overall performance of the game was poor and poorly implemented.
- **Score:** 50%

## 2. Feature Completeness

Feature Completeness measures the extent to which the generated scripts incorporate the requested game features and mechanics.

- **Feature List:** 
1. pygame imports
2. random import
3. Pygame initialization
4. Game settings definitions (WIDTH, HEIGHT, SNAKE_SIZE, FOOD_COUNT)
5. Game window creation
6. Game variable initialization (snake, direction, food)
7. Game loop definition
8. Event handling loop
9. **Game state update for snake movement**(Function error)
10. Snake out-of-bounds check
11. Collision with food check and score update
12. Game elements drawing
13. Game window background fill
14. Food drawing
15. Snake segments drawing
16. Display update
17. Frame rate limitation
18. Pygame quit

- **Scoring:** 17/18

## 3. Bug Frequency

Bug Frequency evaluates the number and severity of defects in the generated scripts.

- **Execute on first try?:** Yes
- **Count of Bugs:** 0
